Heavily inspired (if not straight up plagiarized) by [_MrRedShark77's_](https://mrredshark77.github.io/) github.io page, but since I don't know jack of javascript I tried making it with a heavier focus on html and css, keeping javascript to a minimum.

Huge thanks to 98.css by [jdan](https://github.com/jdan), really has every visual element I've ever wanted.
