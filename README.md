# devinaxo.github.io

Heavily inspired (if not straight up plagiarized) by [_MrRedShark77's_](https://mrredshark77.github.io/) github.io page, but since I don't know jack of javascript I tried making it with a heavier focus on html and css, keeping javascript to a minimum.


## Thanks and credits to
  * [_MrRedShark77's_](https://mrredshark77.github.io/), for his idea of a webpage.
  * 98.css by [jdan](https://github.com/jdan), really has every visual element I've ever wanted.
  * Windows 98 HQ Icons by [Alex Meub](https://alexmeub.com/), these look truly great.
